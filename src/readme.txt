Submission1 is missing a few things,
---------------
1.Is there an appropriate "e-store Options" page? [Think of this a "future proofing" prep for e-store implementation.]
2.Is Site Map OK, including all of its links?
3.Are business specific links and pages OK?
4.Do all pages validate against HTML5 and CSS3? (could be, haven't checked yet)
5.Are all files well formatted? (could be, haven't checked yet)
6.Are all web pages free of spelling and grammatical errors? (could be, haven't checked yet)
