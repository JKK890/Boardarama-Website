                    <p>
                        Boardarama is a brand new business, and this is how it got started. It came to me in a dream, I
                        woke up that morning with a burst of inspiration. In that moment I knew I had to merge my two
                        favorite things, fine cuisine and board games. Like that me and my team of chefs, and board
                        games, and we created something truly amazing.

                    <p>
                        We are aware that some people think that food and board games should be kept separate, I feel
                        bad for those people but to each their own I guess. But for the rest of you, I invite
                        you all to stop by next time you're hungry, wanting to play a board game, or both!
